# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the application

To run the development server, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. From your project's root directory, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
